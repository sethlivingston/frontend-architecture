<h1>Frontend Architecture</h1>
<p><i>A collaborative developer's guide</i></p>
</div>

Frontend code deserves just as much architectural attention as backend code. There's more to it than choosing a directory hierarchy, a UI framework, and maybe a state-management library. Without a robust architecture, frontend apps crumble under the weight of years of feature work and developers who come and go.

This is a collaborative space to make frontend architecture a first-class citizen. Welcome and thanks for participating!

Below you'll find three sections.

1. **High-level principles** set our compass direction and destination.
2. **Mid-level practices** describe how to get there.
3. **Low-level examples** apply the mid-level practices to specific frontend stacks and technologies.

#1 and #2 come from tried-and-true software architecture principles and practices. #3 is where we attempt to fill the frontend architecture gap in our industry.

## High-level principles

Do one thing and do it well

| Designation | Principle                       | Description                                                                                    | Source                                                                                                                                                                                          |
